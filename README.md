# Secure Modules

Attempts to reintroduce CodeSigners to Modules at runtime, Normal java just completely ignores signatures at runtime.

This is a fork of [SecureJarHandler](https://github.com/McModLauncher/securejarhandler) which was originally under the Forge organization but moved to try and unite the community. 
It was moved back to allow for fixes and re-works. Compatiblity will be maintained for the interm however compatibility in Minecraft 1.21+ is not a goal.
